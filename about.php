		This project will be designed that all schools in Nigeria will have to come to the website to register the name of their schools and the number of students intake will be divided into diffferent Zones. e.g North East, South West etc. will have their own registration area. So, Schools can click on the region they belong.
	</p>

	<p>
		The problem solving is to get the accurate data of number of schools and the number of students that are available in that particular region and in total in Nigeria.
	</p>

	<p>
		The solution its by providing a portal in which people from each Zones can register their Schools for accurate data and also to get the number of students.
	</p>

	<p>
		The impact is to enable the government or java center of Nigeria to actually know the number of schools in a region and how to supply the basic amenities in that area or how to help develop the educational sector to allowcate budget properly to that particular lacation.
